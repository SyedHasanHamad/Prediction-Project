The main objective remains consistent: predicting whether a car's 
mileage falls into the high or low category. This prediction task will be accomplished 
through the application of data mining techniques and statistical models. 
Specifically, the report will delve into the utilization of statistical models such as 
Random Forest and Boosting, alongside baselining with Linear Discriminant 
Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic 
Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
